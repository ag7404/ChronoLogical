        <h1>How to Use ChronoLogical</h1>

        <p>Chronological's interface is intuitive and user-friendly to use. However, the directions are listed below.</p>

        <h2>Add an Event</h2>
        <p>To add an event, fill out the time and event details inputs and then press the button labeled 'Add.' The entries will sort themselves according to time.</p>

        <h2>Delete an Event</h2>
        <p>To delete an event, hover over the table row and then click it. A dialog box will appear asking if you really want to delete the event. Click 'Yes' and the event will be removed.</p>
        
        <h2>Clear All Events</h2>
        <p>To remove all events, select the 'Clear' button. It will ask you to confirm your choice, before wiping the table clean of data.</p>

        <h2>Export your Schedule</h2>
        <p>If you would like to export your schedule for later use, select the 'Export' button. The contents of the table will be saved to your computer as a text file, which you can use by importing a schedule.</p>

        <h2>Import your Schedule</h2>
        <p>To import a file, you need to select the file first by clicking the button labeled 'Choose a File.' A file interface will appear, and you can select your file from there. After this, you need to click the 'Submit chosen file' button which will upload the contents of the file to your schedule. Any invalid files will not be accepted.</p>
